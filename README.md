## Features

### 1. Game Selection
- **Supported Games:**  **Badminton**.


### 2. Play Area Marking
- **Precision Marking:** Automatically detects and marks key areas on the court (boundaries, nets, service lines, etc.) using YOLO object detection.
- **Valid Angles**  It is valid only for one  camera angle.

### 3. Shuttle/Ball Tracking
- **Advanced Tracking:** Continuously tracks the shuttlecock or cocks's position, speed, and trajectory using advanced machine learning algorithms.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Offers instant feedback on shot speed, angles, and potential outcomes.
- **Event Detection:** Identifies key events like shuttle hitting the net, out-of-bounds shots, and faults.

### 4. Player Tracking
- **Movement Monitoring:** Tracks players' positions and movements on the court using YOLO and deepSort algorithms.
- **Player Mapping:** Visualizes player activity zones and movement patterns on a court map.
- **Player Movement Metrics:** Provides detailed statistics on distance covered, time spent in active zones, and player fatigue.

### 5. Automated Scoring
- **Real-Time Scoring:** Automatically updates scores based on gameplay events (points, fouls, etc.).
- **Scoreboard Integration:** Syncs seamlessly with digital scoreboards to ensure real-time accuracy.

### 6. Rally Length Calculation
- **Rally Metrics:** Tracks and calculates the length of each rally by time, number of shots, and distance covered by players.
- **Detailed Breakdown:** Provides insights into successful rallies, unforced errors, and overall trends.

### 7. Event Detection
- **Key Event Alerts:** Detects critical events such as game points, fouls, faults, and out-of-bounds shots. Sends alerts for immediate action.
- **Highlight Generation:** Automatically compiles key moments for post-game review.

### 8. Real-Time Commentary (Bonus)
- **Automated Commentary:** Using the Gemini API, generates live commentary for the game, including player performance highlights and key events.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Converts generated commentary into real-time audio for enhanced spectator experience.

### 9. Real-Time Graph Analysis
- **Score Tracking:** Displays a real-time graph showing the current score progression of both players.
- **Shuttlecock Hit Distance:** Provides a graph visualizing the distance covered by the shuttlecock during each hit.
- **Player Speed Analysis:** Continuously monitors and graphs the speed of both players, offering insights into their movements and reactions during the game.

### Algorithms Used
- **TrackNet v3**: Used for shuttlecock tracking and trajectory estimation.
- **DeepSort**: Employed for multi-object tracking (players and shuttlecock).
- **YOLO**: Used for detecting players and other objects in real-time.

These tools and algorithms are essential for real-time object detection, tracking, and analysis in our project.
